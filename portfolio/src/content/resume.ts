      "Cloud engineer in Orange's engagement team, placed onto customer accounts under a consultancy delivery model. Currently on two engagements in parallel, a betting-platform customer's Azure migration and an internal Orange department's Azure platform I architect solo.",
      "On the betting-platform engagement, took over architect responsibility on the Orange side in April 2026 when the previous architect exited; all technical decisions on the account now go through me. Did the bulk of the Terraform module work across the platform (AKS, vWAN, Front Door, ACR, Log Analytics, Managed Grafana, ArgoCD core services), rewriting large parts as the architecture evolved, and built the observability stack from scratch with production alerts in Terraform against the AMBA baseline. Executed the service-by-service migration of roughly 30 microservices from Orange-hosted Windows Server and .NET onto AKS, with peaks above 33 million requests per day on betting days.",
      "Drove the post-migration architecture, including the ServiceBus migration into the customer's new subscription, policy-as-code rollout via EPAC, and a cold-redeploy DR plan for Azure region failure with runbooks for first-line. Also worked alongside the customer's team to stabilise production after migration, where a recurring .NET thread-pool starvation pattern was surfaced via observability, reproduced in a replication harness built from the customer's components, and resolved through an async refactor led by the customer's developers.",
      "During the migration, the betting-platform customer was moved off NGINX Ingress Controller onto Traefik with Gateway API. Serving multiple TLS certificates on a single listener required a hack (one listener name per cert), so I contributed the upstream patch that taught Gateway API to resolve multiple cert secrets on one listener natively. Merged and released in Traefik v3.7.0.",
      "For the internal Orange department, designed and delivered the Azure platform under their IAM and Microsoft 365 automation app, covering the WAF Application Landing Zone subscription layout, ACR and Container Apps for hosting, Azure DNS, and the GitHub repository with Terraform pipelines so the receiving team runs it themselves.",

      "On the aviation customer's PCI fleet, owned the RHEL major-version programme. ClamAV reaching end-of-life on RHEL7 (under extended support) while the application could not be redeployed within the available window forced an in-place upgrade of the roughly 40-host PCI fleet to RHEL8. IPA does not survive in-place, so the IPA nodes were rebuilt as a fresh install on new VMs landing on RHEL9, with the auth layer switching from password sync to AD trust against the PCI Windows AD domain. Rebuilt CIS hardening as an Ansible role to restore the baseline that in-place upgrade had partially reset, and as a parallel track rolled out the Sumologic OpenTelemetry agent across all 150 RHEL hosts via Ansible.",
